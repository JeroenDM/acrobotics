# Acrobotics

Quickly test motion planning ideas is the goal, and Python seems like a great language for rapid prototyping. There are great libraries for robot simulation and related task, but installing them is can be a hassle and very dependent on operating system and python version.
The drawback is that I have to write a lot of stuff myself. I'm not sure if it is useful to do this. But it will be fun and I will learn a buch.

This library provides robot kinematics and collision checking for serial kinematic chains. The idea is that this library can be easily swapped by another one providing the same functionality.

The acro part comes from [ACRO](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/acro) a robotics research group at KU Leuven in Belgium.
